Hi! My name is **Alberto Ibarrondo**, a first-year CIFRE (industrial) PhD student in the Digital Security department at [EURECOM](http://www.eurecom.fr/en) and the crypto team of [IDEMIA](https://www.idemia.com/), under the supervision of [Melek Önen](http://www.eurecom.fr/~onen/index.html) (EURECOM) and [Hervé Chabanne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/herv%C3%A9-chabanne-2627727/?originalSubdomain=fr) (IDEMIA). 

My current research lies in the field of Secure Multiparty Computation. More concretely, I am focused on protecting advanced Biometric Identification methods based on modern Convolutional Neural Networks (such as face recognition).
