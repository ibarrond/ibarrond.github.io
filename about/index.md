__Be A Voice, not an Echo__ is a professional blog to share knowledge related to Data Science, Machine/Deep Learning, Big Data, Security, Cryptography and Development related to all of them. Since it is a rather small project, most of the ideas an opinions might be a bit biased, but they are all grounded on experience.

> If you'd like to contribute and share ideas beyond making a few comments, feel free to [contact me](https://ibarrond.github.io/#contact)

If you're an engineer yourself but you feel discouraged to share your knowledge, please reconsider! It is by first sharing what we already possess that we get to expand our horizons. There are many good alternatives to having a small blog like this one (LinkedIn posts, Medium, DZone to name a few). Nevertheless, if you like the style and wish to reproduce it yourself, have a look at the [source code](https://github.com/ibarrond/BeAVoice) or check out the [original template](https://github.com/jekyller/jasper2).
